# Known cleanup limits and potential future hardening:
#
# - A POSIX descendant that creates a new session or process group escapes the
#   managed process group. Current supported solvers do not do this.
# - Simultaneous supervisor and guard loss can leave an external solver alive
#   before either cleanup owner responds.
# - A failed Windows taskkill leaves only the direct-child kill fallback.
# - SIGKILL cannot remove a process in uninterruptible kernel sleep until its
#   kernel operation returns.
# - Forced group termination can leave dead descendants as zombies when the
#   container's PID 1 does not reap them.
#
# Linux cgroups, Windows Job Objects, and an init reaper could close these gaps.
# They are intentionally deferred because the active-process cases are unlikely
# with the current solvers.
