# Core Guidelines

The FastAPI backend entry point is `nurse_scheduling/serve.py`.

## Setup And Commands
Run commands from `core/`:

- `uv venv --python 3.12 && source .venv/bin/activate`
- `uv pip install -r requirements-optional.txt`: the development install. See
  the Dependencies section below.
- `python -m nurse_scheduling.cli <input.yaml> [output.csv] --solver <selector>`: selectors are documented in `../README.md`.
- `pytest`: run the normal core test suite with logs captured unless a test fails.
- `pytest <affected_test_paths>`
- `../scripts/test_core_affected.sh`: run full Ruff checks and compact affected
  pytest suites. AI code and bundled guidance changes run all `test_ai_*.py`
  files. Other source, helper, dependency, and deleted-file changes run the
  normal local suite.
- `pytest tests/real/schedule_ortools_cp_sat.py`: run the slower bounded real-world checks.
- `pytest tests/real/schedule_score_ground_truth.py`: replay the fixed real-world assignment and verify its exact objective score.
- `python -m nurse_scheduling.cli tests/testcases/real/large-ward-with-87-people-2025-11.yaml --solver ortools/cp-sat --timeout 10 --show-model-build-stats`: print compact real-case model-build statistics.
- `python tests/real/solver_capabilities.py --solver ortools/cp-sat`: probe
  timeout, cancel, and finish-now behavior on the large real scenario.
- `pytest tests/test_solver_ortools_cp_sat.py tests/test_schedule_ortools_cp_sat.py`: run the primary solver/schedule suites.
- `ruff check nurse_scheduling tests`
- `ruff format nurse_scheduling tests`

After modifying core code, run Ruff and affected pytest suites before finishing.
Prefer `../scripts/test_core_affected.sh` for routine validation. Pass explicit
test paths when a narrower suite is known to be sufficient. Use `--base REF` to
include committed branch changes since the merge base with `REF`, `--list` to
inspect selection without running checks, or `--full` for the normal local
suite. Run optional solver and real-scenario suites explicitly when affected.

## Dependencies
- `requirements.txt` is the minimal runtime set. Deployment images install only
  it, so a small file keeps those builds fast. Add a package there only when
  the CLI, the backend, or the AI service imports it at runtime.
- `requirements-optional.txt` starts with `-r requirements.txt` and adds the
  extra solver backends, the sandbox-only attachment tool packages, and the
  test and lint tooling. It is the development and CI install.
- A package a sandbox tool imports belongs in the optional file even when the
  tool ships under `nurse_scheduling/`. Those scripts are uploaded and run
  inside the E2B image, which installs its own pinned copies, and only the
  tests import them here. Keep the two pin sets in step.
- Keep an optional solver reachable through a lazy import and let
  `server/solver_options.py` report it unavailable. It already treats
  `ImportError` as unavailable, so a missing optional backend must degrade
  rather than break startup.
- Verify a dependency move by installing `requirements.txt` alone into a
  throwaway virtual environment, then importing `nurse_scheduling.cli`,
  `serve`, `ai_serve`, `server.diagnostic`, and `server.usage_report`, and
  running one CLI solve with `--prettify` to reach the XLSX export path.
  Reading the imports is not enough, because transitive-only packages such as
  the `jinja2` that `pandas.DataFrame.style` needs have no import statement.

## Server Job Processes
- `run_optimization_process` owns its optimization process tree through
  `server/jobs/process_tree.py`. Tree cleanup is required for PuLP command-line
  backends, which launch external solver executables. OR-Tools runs inside the
  direct optimization child and does not require descendant cleanup.
- The child finish-now event is exclusively for cooperative early completion.
  Cancellation and internal aborts terminate the optimization process tree
  immediately.
- Worker shutdown uses normal claim expiry recovery. Do not add a separate
  persisted shutdown failure unless immediate terminal state becomes required.
- A background loop that retries a dependency on a fixed interval must wrap its
  failures in `RepeatedFailure`, so one outage reports once and backs off rather
  than reporting every attempt.
- A worker that cannot persist an execution outcome must relinquish its lease.
  Continue only after cleanup succeeds, otherwise stop the claim loop.

## Experimental AI
- Keep attachment limits server-configured and report them through
  `/capabilities`. Attachments and the optimizer tool are always offered.
  Keep schedules and attachments separate from model instructions.
- Bound uploads before provider calls and place them under fixed sandbox paths.
  Do not retain raw attachments longer than their documented turn behavior requires.
- Keep model-facing prompts and intermediate messages concise. Avoid repeated
  warnings about malicious uploads or prescribed workbook-inspection commands.
  Rely on sandbox and server controls for security, and give generated artifacts
  exact paths when available.
- Keep bundled attachment helpers general and optional. Preserve meaningful
  source data such as spreadsheet formulas and cached values, report truncation,
  and let the agent write a focused sandbox parser when a helper is insufficient.
- Sandbox allocation is lazy. Tests that verify attachment hydration must make
  the agent call a tool, since a text-only turn never creates a sandbox.
- Keep canonical schedule invariants in `NurseSchedulingData`. Implement
  consumer-specific subsets through explicit Pydantic entry points rather than
  input-controlled or global validation flags.
- The assistant is reachable only from the web frontend, so its schedule tools
  target the frontend subset alone. Validate through
  `ai/validation.py`, and do not expose the canonical backend flavor, which
  accepts shapes the editor cannot represent.
- Frontend validation checks normalized frontend state, not raw import
  compatibility. Do not broaden it merely because an import path can convert
  or repair additional input shapes.
- Keep schedule facts out of the prompt summary in `describe_schedule` and put
  them in a tool result instead. The evaluation asserts that a reading case
  cannot be answered from the summary alone, so listing item IDs or line numbers
  there turns a reading case into a copying case. See
  `test_reading_questions_cannot_be_answered_from_the_prompt_summary`.
- Decide what to fix next by tallying failed tool calls across a whole
  evaluation run, not from one trajectory. A repeated recoverable failure costs
  more than the case that exposed it, and a bounded tool should clamp an
  over-large request rather than refuse it.
- For AI behavior changes, run deterministic affected pytest checks first. Then
  smoke-test the smallest relevant live evaluation set with repeatable
  `./scripts/run_ai_eval.sh --case CASE_ID` selectors from the repository root.
  Include a contrasting control for ambiguity or scope changes. Expand to a
  category or tag only when the changed behavior spans it or a selected case
  reveals a neighboring risk. A bare evaluation command exits without running
  cases. Use `--tuning` to opt into the default tuning set.
- Treat one provider pass as a smoke check. Before claiming a tuning improvement,
  repeat affected cases at least three times with four total jobs and compare
  pass rate, infrastructure failures, turns, and tokens with a recorded baseline.
  Reserve `--tuning` for broad changes or final tuning confirmation.
  Use `--full` only when explicitly requested, for release-level confirmation,
  or when cross-cutting behavior could affect cases outside the tuning set.
  Otherwise report the selected cases and that the wider evaluation was not run.
- For live AI evaluations, load provider and E2B credentials from the ignored
  repository-root `docker/.env`, or `docker/.env.staging` if it does not exist,
  in the evaluation process. Never print or commit credential values. Check
  that the selected file and required values exist before starting. If absent,
  report the missing configuration instead of running a known-to-fail evaluation.
  Use four concurrent case jobs.
- Pair ambiguous-language cases with exact-target controls so clarification
  guidance does not teach the agent to ask when the user already supplied a
  unique ID. Keep structurally different fixtures under a `holdout` tag. Do not
  tune prompts directly against one held-out trajectory.
- Expose Pi's default `read`, `bash`, `edit`, and `write` model tools over
  the disposable sandbox. Always offer the server-side `optimizer` lifecycle
  tool. Keep optimizer execution and credentials outside
  the sandbox. Match the browser's basic optimizer anonymization, retain the
  reverse ID map server-side, restore IDs before download, and pass retained
  workbooks into a dedicated sandbox result path, separate from user attachments.
  Use `read` for bounded text and image inspection, `edit` for unique
  exact-text replacements, and `write` only for a complete file rewrite. Put
  domain guidance in task-sized reference documents that return related schema
  shapes together instead of adding model-specific tools or fine-grained lookup
  turns. Keep trusted validation after every possible schedule change and the
  structural diff at review, since those catch a dropped entry that still
  parses. Emit an intermediate working-copy preview only after that trusted
  validation.
- Run a provider batch concurrently only when every call is read-only. Preserve
  call order in the returned results, keep mixed or mutating batches sequential,
  and make sandbox close wait for active reads before teardown.
- Keep model-facing tool contracts and output behavior in pinned Pi ports under
  `ai/pi`. Keep E2B execution and service timeout policy in the thin sandbox
  adapter so upstream behavior remains identifiable and testable.
- When changing `ai/pi`, compare with the exact upstream Pi revision cited in
  the module header. Preserve model-facing wording and edge-case behavior, add
  focused regression tests, and document intentional differences beside the port.
- Retry a provider timeout only before any stream event reaches the caller.
  Once text, reasoning, usage, or a tool call is visible, surface the timeout
  rather than replaying the request and risking duplicate output or tool work.

## Server Authentication
- `API_AUTH_TOKEN` is the optional legacy credential. Authentication is
  disabled only when neither legacy nor identified credentials are configured,
  which keeps local runs and older clients working.
- `API_AUTH_TOKENS` accepts a JSON object mapping IDs to keys. IDs are for
  administration and audit logs only. Clients continue to send only the key as
  a bearer token and must never receive the ID. Keep `legacy` reserved for
  `API_AUTH_TOKEN`.
- Identified keys attribute requests, they do not isolate them. Every key
  reaches every protected route and every job. Do not present them as tenants
  or add per-key ownership checks without a deliberate multi-tenancy design.
- `API_AUTH_REQUIRED` makes a token mandatory and is set in the deployment images,
  so a published backend fails to start rather than serving openly by accident.
  Leave it unset outside those images.
- `/optimize/{job_id}/events` accepts a signed, job-scoped, expiring URL token as
  well as the bearer header, because `EventSource` cannot set headers. Mint it
  into `links.events`; never put a bearer key itself in a URL, and never put a
  stable key-derived value such as a per-key selector there either, because it
  correlates every stream a key opens and never expires. Verify the token
  against each configured key instead. Its lifetime
  comes from `ServerSettings.stream_token_ttl_seconds`, which tracks the longest
  run the deployment allows.
- Keep `/info` and `/ready` public. Clients discover the requirement from
  `/info`, and deployment probes must not need credentials. Gate every other
  route with the bearer-auth dependency.
- The separately deployed AI service uses `AI_AUTH_TOKEN` or `AI_AUTH_TOKENS`
  when configured. Keep
  `/health`, `/ready`, and `/capabilities` public, advertise the effective bearer
  auth requirement through `/capabilities`, and gate every session route when a
  token is set. Native runs may omit auth. Docker Compose services set
  `AI_AUTH_REQUIRED=true`; opting out must be explicit in the env file and must
  leave `AI_AUTH_TOKEN` and `AI_AUTH_TOKENS` empty.
- `AI_AUTH_TOKENS` provides the same JSON static-key behavior for the AI
  service. Either legacy or identified keys satisfy required-auth startup.

## Input Limits
- Bound submitted scheduling data by its alias expansion and nesting depth as
  well as its byte size. `loader.measure_yaml_expansion` measures both from the
  parse events without building the structure, and both the API and `load_data`
  refuse past either bound. Read untrusted data off the event loop.

## Testing
- Normal tests live under `tests/`.
- Derive a fixture timestamp from the current clock whenever the code under test
  compares it against real time, such as a Redis `EXPIREAT` or a retention
  window. A hardcoded date passes until that instant arrives and then fails for
  a reason the assertion does not name. `tests/test_usage_metrics.py` shifts its
  whole timeline onto the current reporting week for this reason.
- Resolve input selectors and input-derived invariants in
  `NurseSchedulingData.compiled_schedule`. Scheduler, preference, and export
  phases should consume that representation instead of reparsing YAML fields.
- Treat a validated schedule and its compiled representation as one snapshot.
  Revalidate changed input instead of mutating a validated model and reusing
  stale compiled data.
- Keep server-facing solver traits in
  `nurse_scheduling/server/solver_capabilities.py`. Runtime control checks and
  `/optimize/options` must use that registry rather than duplicate selector
  lists.
- Real-world checks under `tests/real/` intentionally omit pytest's `test_`
  filename prefix. Run them explicitly; do not include them in normal test
  commands.
- Primary suites are:
  `tests/test_solver_ortools_cp_sat.py`,
  `tests/test_solver_ortools_linear.py`,
  `tests/test_solver_ortools_mathopt.py`,
  `tests/test_solver_pulp_glpk.py`,
  `tests/test_solver_pulp_python.py`,
  `tests/test_schedule_ortools_cp_sat.py`,
  `tests/test_schedule_ortools_mpsolver_cbc.py`,
  `tests/test_schedule_ortools_mathopt_gscip.py`, and `tests/test_serve.py`.
  PuLP/GLPK has bounded schedule smoke coverage in
  `tests/test_schedule_pulp_glpk.py`. PuLP Python-API schedule coverage lives
  in `tests/test_schedule_pulp_highs.py` and `tests/test_schedule_pulp_scip.py`.
- Add scheduling cases as fixture pairs under `tests/testcases/**`, typically a
  `.yaml` input with matching `.csv` or `.txt` expected output.
- Use `--show-model-build-stats` when checking or benchmarking model-building
  optimizations against real testcases. It emits a compact aggregated summary
  and suppresses the full schedule output.
- Core tests run on Linux, macOS, and Windows in CI. Keep tests platform
  neutral, including paths, line endings, and environment limits.
- Give `pytest.mark.parametrize` explicit `ids` when a parameter is a large
  binary or text payload. Pytest derives the node ID from the parameter value
  and exports it through `PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST`, which fails on Windows once the
  ID exceeds the 32767-character environment variable limit.

## Python Style
- Use 4-space indentation, `snake_case` functions/modules, and `PascalCase`
  classes. Keep type names explicit.
- Treat existing comments and docstrings as durable project knowledge. When
  moving or replacing code, preserve their information near the replacement.
  Do not silently delete them unless the documented behavior is obsolete, and
  explain that decision during review.
- Core linting and formatting use Ruff.
- Every Python file must use the repository module-docstring and AGPL header
  convention documented in `../docs/agent-license-headers.md`.
- Mark a file written entirely by an AI coding agent immediately after the license
  block, using `# This test is mostly AI generated.` for anything under `tests/`,
  including helpers and runners, and `# This file is mostly AI generated.` in any
  other new file. Editing a file someone else wrote does not earn a marker.

## v2 notes
This file is genie `core/AGENTS.md` with only this section added (lane 07 D17,
lane 05 L5-30), so it syncs like any other patched file. The repository root
`AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` come first. Where the rules above do not fit v2:

- v2 does not vendor the Python AI package, `ai_serve.py`,
  `frontend_validation.py`, `usage_report.py` or the performance benchmark
  (spec X5, X6). Skip the Experimental AI rules, the AI service auth rules and
  the `ai_serve` and `usage_report` import checks.
  `../scripts/test_core_affected.sh` and `../docs/agent-license-headers.md` do
  not exist in v2.
- The product runs OR-Tools CP-SAT only (X4). The other solvers stay as a
  library so that upstream syncs stay clean. Install
  `requirements-optional.txt` to run their tests.
- Auth stays off. The backend is private behind the web BFF (X7). Usage
  telemetry stays off (X6).
- Core CI runs on Linux only.
- Every file in `core/` has one row in `upstream-patches/manifest.toml`:
  `verbatim`, `patched`, `v2-only` or `excluded`. Add a row when you add a
  file. Change a `verbatim` file only by syncing it from upstream. After you
  change a `patched` file, rebuild its patch with
  `python -m scripts.sync_upstream --repo <v1 clone> --refresh-patches`. Put new
  v2 behavior in a `v2-only` module where you can, not in an upstream file.
- Before you finish core work, run from `core/`: `ruff check .`,
  `ruff format --check .`, `python -m scripts.check_upstream_sync` and
  `pytest`. The sync recipe is in `docs/T19-upstream-backend-source-manifest.md`.
