name: run-ci
description: Run and fix the repository's local CI checks when asked to "Run CI", "Run all CI", or verify all CI locally. Runs core lint and the normal core pytest suite with coverage, then runs frontend lint, build, unit coverage, and Playwright E2E coverage. Fix failures and rerun until the full script passes.

# Run CI

Run the bundled script from any directory by calling it with an absolute path
to the skill folder:

```bash
bash /path/to/skills/run-ci/scripts/run-ci.sh /path/to/repository
```

Resolve `scripts/run-ci.sh` relative to this skill directory, not the target
repository. When the repository path is omitted, the script uses the current
working directory.

The script intentionally:

- Does not explicitly run the `core/tests/real/schedule_ortools_cp_sat.py`
  scenario. The normal pytest suite still exercises the OR-Tools backend
  through the remaining tests.
- Runs core Ruff format checking, Ruff lint, and the normal pytest suite with
  coverage.
- Runs frontend lint, build, unit coverage, E2E coverage, and the E2E coverage
  report. Coverage commands execute the tests, so do not run duplicate
  non-coverage test commands.
- Does not upload coverage or artifacts.

Do not replace the script with affected-test commands. When a check fails,
diagnose and fix the underlying error while preserving repository conventions
and unrelated user changes. Run a focused check when useful to verify the fix,
then rerun the bundled script from the beginning. Repeat until the full script
passes.

Do not weaken, skip, or alter checks merely to make CI pass. If a required
dependency or Playwright browser is missing, install it using the repository's
documented setup commands, then rerun the script. Report a blocker only when
the failure cannot be fixed locally.
